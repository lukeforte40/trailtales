**OverView**
This project will serve as a travel journal and Trip planner and recommendation engine as well as a project to deepen my understanding of java spring with react.js. It serves as a resume builder and a project that I believe will be useful to me and my friends. I might consider monetization and/or developing a mobile app at a later date to increase accessability.
